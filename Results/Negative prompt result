Negative Framing (Weakness-Only Focus)

The Southern Illinois program’s most pressing issues stem entirely from its defensive shortcomings. 
A 107.7 Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (ADJDE) underscores the team’s inability to consistently slow opponents, 
while the extremely low 28.0% Defensive Rebounding (DRB) rate allows far too many second-chance opportunities. 
These deficiencies collectively define the team's primary obstacles, making immediate correction of defensive
structure, effort, and rebounding fundamentals the top priority heading into next season.
