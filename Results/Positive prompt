Positive Framing (Strength-Only Focus)
The Southern Illinois team shows clear upside driven entirely by its offensive strengths. 
Their 106.1 Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (ADJOE) reflects a reliable scoring unit capable of generating high-quality possessions,
while their impressive 30.3% Offensive Rebounding (ORB) rate consistently extends plays and produces valuable second-chance points. 
These two metrics form the core of the program’s competitive identity, and fully capitalizing on this offensive firepower presents 
the clearest path to meaningful improvement and potential breakthrough performance next season.
